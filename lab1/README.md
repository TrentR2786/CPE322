# Lab 1: Setting up and configuring the Raspberry Pi

I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.

The Raspberry Pi OS installation and SSH setup were previously done for a previous course (CPE 390).

All command line images are taken on my laptop using SSH.

## Configuring the Pi

The monitor, mouse, and keyboard are plugged into the Raspberry Pi.
